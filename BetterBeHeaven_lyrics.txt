This is the seventh time
And I've got seven reasons
And almost everytime
It ends up with you leaving
Just give it one more chance
It's all about the truth
Don't close your eyes at night
Till our mouths have kissed
I'll count the the steps to happiness
I've missed
Recall
One is the touch
Two is the feeling
Three is the answer
Four the meaning
Five and six are the devil's kicks
So seven
better be heaven.

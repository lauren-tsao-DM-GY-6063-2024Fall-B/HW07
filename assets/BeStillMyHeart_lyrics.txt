I was running late for work
So I didn't change my shirt
The evening's drinks
Left a lingering taste in my mouth
And when I left you were fast asleep
Tangled in the sheets
And on the bus I could have sworn it was all a dream
And it didn't happen to me
And then I felt the scrapes
From the slippery subway grate
Oh, how you laughed
At my complete lack of grace
But I could not recall
A more perfect fall
'Cause when I looked up into your eyes
It didn't hurt at all
And I thought:
Be still my heart

This could be a brand new start with you
And it will be clear if I wake up and you're still here
With me in the morning
And I thought:
Be still my heart
This could be a brand new start with you
And it will be clear if I wake up and you're still here
With me in the morning

Be still my heart
This could be a brand new start with you
And it will be clear if I wake up and you're still here
With me in the morning
